# Car Price Prediction Web App using Streamlit

This repository contains code to build a web application that predicts the selling price of cars based on various features using machine learning.
The model is trained using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm on the car dataset.
## features
Predict the price of a car based on its features.

Explore the dataset and visualize the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is available in the file `CAR DETAILS.csv`. 
It contains the following columns:

- `name`: Car model name
- `year`: Year of the car
- `selling_price`: Selling price of the car (target variable)
- `km_driven`: Kilometers driven by the car
- `fuel`: Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)
- `seller_type`: Type of seller (Individual, Dealer)
- `transmission`: Transmission type (Manual, Automatic)
- `owner`: Number of previous owners
- `company`: Car manufacturing company

## Prerequisites

To run the Streamlit app, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- streamlit

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
```

## How to Run the Streamlit App

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avanishah111/Datascience_capstone_project.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd car-price-prediction-app
```
3. Make sure you have the `CAR DETAILS.csv` file in the project directory.
   
4. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:
 ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
For Windows:venv\Scripts\activate

For Unix or Linux:source venv/bin/activate
```
5. Install the required dependencies:
 ```bash 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ``` 
6.Run the Streamlit app: 
 ```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
7. Run the Streamlit app.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
8. The web app will open in your default browser, and you can use it to predict car prices based on the provided features.


## Model Information

The machine learning model used in this app is based on the Random Forest Regressor algorithm.

The dataset is preprocessed using one-hot encoding for categorical features, and the model is trained on the training set.

The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training and testing datasets.
